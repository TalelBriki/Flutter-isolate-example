# Flutter Isolates Demo

This repository demonstrates the usage of Dart isolates in Flutter with two separate examples:

1. **Image Processing with Isolates**: This example shows how to process an image (convert it to grayscale) using Dart isolates in Flutter.
2. **File Reading with Isolates**: This example demonstrates reading a large file in the background using isolates to keep the UI responsive.

Additionally, there is another Flutter project inside this repository that uses the `flutter_isolates` package to show how to work with isolates more efficiently.
